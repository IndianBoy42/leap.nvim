USAGE                                                               *leap-usage*

Command sequence in Normal mode, with the default settings:

`s|S char1 char2 <space>? (<space>|<tab>)* label?`

That is,

- invoke in the forward (`s`) or backward (`S`) direction
- enter the first character of the search pattern

  | the "beacons" are lit at this point; all potential matches (`char1` + `?`)
  | are labeled

- enter the second character of the search pattern (might short-circuit after
  this, if there is only one match)

  | certain beacons are extinguished; only `char1` + `char2` matches remain

  | the cursor automatically jumps to the first match if there are enough
  | "safe" labels (|leap-config|); pressing any other key than a group-switch
  | or a target label exits the plugin now

- optionally cycle through the groups of matches that can be labeled at once
- choose a labeled target to jump to (in the current group)

                                       *leap-operator-pending-mode* *leap-z/Z/x/X*
In Operator-pending mode, there are two different (pairs of) default motions
available, providing the necessary additional comfort and precision, since in
that case we are targeting exact positions, and can only aim once, without the
means of easy correction.

`z`/`Z` are the equivalents of `s`/`S`, and they follow the semantics of `/`
and `?` in terms of cursor placement and inclusive/exclusive operational
behaviour, including |forced-motion| types.

`x`/`X` provide missing variants for the two directions; the mnemonics could
be e(x)tend/e(X)clude:

ab···|                    |···ab
█████·  ←  Zab    zab  →  ████ab
ab███·  ←  Xab    xab  →  ██████

As you can see from the figure, `x` goes to the end of the match, including it
in the operation, while `X` stops just before - in an absolute sense, after -
the end of the match (the equivalent of `T` for Leap motions). In simpler
terms: `x`/`X` both shift the relevant edge of the operated area by +2.

                                                                *leap-match-eol*
A character at the end of a line can be targeted by pressing `<space>`
(`special_keys.eol`) after it.

                                                             *leap-cross-window*
`gs` searches in all the other windows on the tab page. In this case, the
matches are sorted by their screen distance from the cursor, advancing in
concentric circles.

                                                    *leap-repeat* *leap-traversal*
Pressing `<enter>` (`special_keys.repeat_search`) after invoking any of Leap's
motions searches with the previous input.

After entering at least one input character, `<enter>`
(`special_keys.next_match`) moves on to the immediate next match (enters
traversal mode). Once in traversal mode, `<tab>` (`special_keys.prev_match`)
can revert the previous jump - that is, it puts the cursor back to its
previous position, allowing for an easy correction when you accidentally
overshoot your target.

`s|S char1 <enter> (<enter>|<tab>)*`

`s|S char1 char2 <enter>? (<enter>|<tab>)*`

Of course, the two can be combined - you can immediately move on after a
repeated search:

`s|S <enter> <enter>? (<enter>|<tab>)*`

Entering traversal mode after the first input is a useful shortcut, especially
in operator-pending mode, but it can also be used as a substitute for
normal-mode |f|/|t| motions. `s{char}<enter>` is the same as `f{char}`, but
works over multiple lines.

If the safe label set is in use (|leap-config|), the labels will remain
available during the whole time, even after entering traversal mode.

Note: For cross-window search, traversal mode is not supported.

                                                               *leap-dot-repeat*
You can repeat change and delete operations with the `.` character, if
repeat.vim (https://github.com/tpope/vim-repeat) is installed.

==============================================================================
CONFIGURATION                                                      *leap-config*

Setting an individual option via the `opts` table directly:

`   require('leap').opts.case_sensitive = true`

Setting multiple options via the `setup` function: >

    require('leap').setup {
        case_sensitive = true,
        labels = { ... }
    }
<
    Note: These will be merged with the current/default settings. (Settings
          not mentioned here are not disturbed.)

Available options~

`highlight_ahead_of_time = true`

    Enable two-step processing: show labels and/or highlight matches right
    after the first input character.

`highlight_unlabeled = false`

    Whether to highlight all unlabeled matches. (Matches covering labels will
    get highlighted anyway.)

    Note: This is only relevant if `highlight_ahead_of_time` is enabled.

`case_sensitive = false`

    Whether to consider case in search patterns.

`safe_labels` >
    {"s", "f", "n",
     "u", "t",
     "/", "F", "L", "N", "H", "G", "M", "U", "T", "?", "Z"}
<
    When the number of matches does not exceed the number of these "safe"
    labels plus one, the plugin jumps to the first match automatically after
    entering the pattern. Obviously, for this purpose you should choose keys
    that are unlikely to be used right after a jump!
    Leaving the list empty (or setting it to `nil`) effectively disables the
    auto-jump feature.

    Note: Operator-pending mode ignores this, all targets (if multiple found)
          are labeled then (using the `labels` list, if not empty).

`labels` >
    {"s", "f", "n",
     "j", "k", "l", "o", "d", "w", "e", "h", "m", "v", "g",
     "u", "t",
     "c", ".", "z",
     "/", "F", "L", "N", "H", "G", "M", "U", "T", "?", "Z"}
<
    Target labels to be used when there are more matches than the number of
    safe labels plus one.
    Leaving the list empty (or setting it to `nil`) forces auto-jump to always
    be on, except for Operator-pending mode. In this case, do not forget to
    set `special_keys.next_group` to something "safe" too.

    Heuristics behind the defaults:
    - At least the first few labels should be the same on the two lists, since
      those become muscle memory, and might be used automatically, a bit like
      [count] values.
    - Since the commands invoking the motions are mapped to left-hand keys by
      default, we tend to prioritize right-hand keys to get a better balance
      for the whole sequence on average.

`special_keys` >
    {
      repeat_search = '<enter>',
      next_match    = '<enter>',
      prev_match    = '<tab>',
      next_group    = '<space>',
      prev_group    = '<tab>',
      eol           = '<space>',
    }
<
    Keys captured by the plugin at runtime, to:
    - repeat with the previous input after invocation (|leap-repeat|)
    - jump to the next/previous match in traversal mode (|leap-traversal|)
    - switch to the next/previous group of matches, when there are more
      matches than labels available (|leap-usage|)
    - target characters before EOL

==============================================================================
DEFAULT KEYMAPS                                           *leap-default-keymaps*

The defaults can be set by calling `require('leap').set_default_keymaps()`.
Note that the function will check for conflicts with any custom mappings
created by you or other plugins, and will not overwite them, unless explicitly
told so (called with a `true` argument).

Trigger keys~

Normal mode

s{char}{char}              Jump to the first character of {char}{char}
                           in the forward direction.
S{char}{char}              Jump to the first character of {char}{char}
                           in the backward direction.

Visual mode

s{char}{char}              Extend visual selection up to and including the
                           first character of {char}{char} in the forward
                           direction.
S{char}{char}              Extend visual selection up to and including the
                           first character of {char}{char} in the backward
                           direction.

Operator-pending mode

{operator}z{char}{char}    Perform {operator} from the cursor up to the first
                           character of {char}{char} in the forward direction.
{operator}Z{char}{char}    Perform {operator} from the cursor up to and
                           including the first character of {char}{char} in
                           the backward direction. (|exclusive| motion: the
                           cursor position is not included without |o_v|.)

{operator}x{char}{char}    Perform {operator} from the cursor up to and
                           including the second character of {char}{char} in
                           the forward direction.
{operator}X{char}{char}    Perform {operator} from the cursor up to the second
                           character of {char}{char} in the backward
                           direction. (|exclusive| motion: the cursor position
                           is not included without |o_v|.)

Special keys~

<enter>                    Repeat with the previous input (after invocation);
                           jump to the next match in |leap-traversal| mode.
<space>                    Substitute for an EOL character (after the first
                           input); shift to the next group of labeled matches
                           (after the second input).
<tab>                      Revert the previous jump (|leap-traversal| mode) or
                           the previous group shift.
<esc>                      Exit Leap at any stage cleanly.

==============================================================================
CUSTOM KEYMAPS                                             *leap-custom-keymaps*

<Plug> keys are aliases for right hand sides of mappings - in our case, Lua
method calls. If you are not familiar with the concept, see |<Plug>| and
|using-<Plug>|.

Available <Plug> keys:

*<Plug>(leap-forward)*        /-like (offset: 0; as operation: exclusive)
*<Plug>(leap-backward)*       ?-like (offset: 0; as operation: exclusive)
*<Plug>(leap-forward-x)*             (offset: 1; as operation: inclusive)
*<Plug>(leap-backward-x)*            (offset: 2; as operation: exclusive)
*<Plug>(leap-cross-window)*

The keys for repeating the search, and for switching between groups of matches
can be set via `opts.special_keys` (|leap-config|).

==============================================================================
HIGHLIGHTING                                                    *leap-highlight*

Leap uses the following highlight groups that you can configure to your own
liking (using |nvim_set_hl()|):

    *LeapMatch*
        Matches that can be reached directly, without having to use a label.
        (By default, this is only used for traversal mode, or when a match
        covers a label, indicating the conflict.)

    *LeapLabelPrimary*
        The character needed to be pressed to jump to the match position,
        after the whole search pattern has been given. It appears once the
        first input has been entered, right next to the pair.

    *LeapLabelSecondary*
        If the number of matches exceeds the available target labels, the next
        group of labeled targets are shown with a different color. Those can
        be reached by pressing `<space>` (`special_keys.next_group`)
        before the label character.

    *LeapBackdrop*
        In some cases it might be useful or even necessary to apply certain
        settings on the rest of the area, like disabling all `gui` attributes,
        or adding a uniform grey foreground color, to make the Leap matches
        and labels more distinguishable.

In order to preserve your custom settings after changing the colorscheme, you
might want to wrap them in a function, and define an autocommand like below.
(Leap does the same, but with |:hi-default|, so it will not overwrite yours.)
>
    vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd('ColorScheme', {
      callback = function ()
        vim.api.nvim_set_hl(0, 'LeapMatch', { <def. map> })
        -- etc.
      end
    })

==============================================================================
EVENTS                                                             *leap-events*

The |User| event is triggered with the following patterns on entering/exiting
Leap (not in traversal mode):

*LeapEnter*
*LeapLeave*

Example: >
    vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd('User', {
      pattern = 'LeapEnter',
      command = 'nohlsearch',
    })
    vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd('User', {
      pattern = 'LeapLeave',
      command = 'let &hlsearch=&hlsearch',
    })
